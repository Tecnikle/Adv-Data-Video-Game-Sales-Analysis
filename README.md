# Adv-Data-Video-Game-Sales-Analysis
## Main Description
This is a repository to store all of the information and progress I make with my analysis project for my Advanced Data Analytics course.

## Data Set and why I chose it
[Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/archissave/video-game-sales?resource=download)   
My data sets contains the Name, system released on, year of release, publisher, genre, and the sales split across NA, EU, and JP.   
I'm interested in this topic because I love games and I've been gaming since I was a kid. My goal with this data set is to map sales trends within series (Call of Duty, Battlefield, Super Mario, etc.) as well as overall yearly sales trends in order to see how consumer tastes might shift from year to year.  
For example, did the sales of one game within a series increase because it was more well-received or because the general sales of the year increased.

## Additional Info
I have a lot of hypotheses I can and want to test, and I will test that at different points throughout my project. 
This is important because it allows me to always have something new to find and show as different assignments are given instead of just rewriting the same find repeateadly.
